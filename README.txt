- Tai Heritage Pro Release 2.510 -- November 2016
=========================================================

Thank you for your interest in Tai Heritage Pro. The 2009 release of Version 2.000 represented a major upgrade to the original Tai Heritage font, incorporating Unicode encoding and Graphite technology for correctly positioning the vowel and tone marks of the Tai Viet script. Version 2.500 added a bold face font, and gives the choice of either Graphite or Open Type rendering technology. Version 2.510 corrected a noncritical error in the OpenType code. See FONTLOG.txt and TaiHeritageProFontFeatures.pdf for more information.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
In order to obtain the correct placement of combining marks, this font should be used with applications that use one of these rendering technologies:

	- OpenType. (Note that at the time of release, the OpenType rendering requires ICU shaping. Microsoft shaping engines such as Uniscribe do not yet support the Tai Viet script.) 

	- Graphite. See http://scripts.sil.org/GraphiteFAQ "What applications support Graphite?"

When used in an application without either of these rendering technologies, the font will still be mostly readable, but the placement of combining marks  will not be optimal, and there will occasionally be collisions between adjacent characters.

Tai Heritage Pro 2.500 has been tested on a Windows 7 platform using LibreOffice, WorldPad, and XeTeX, as well as on a Linux platform using XeTeX.

INSTALLATION
------------
  - Run the font installer EXE, or 
  - expand the zip file, and drag the .ttf files onto the Fonts folder icon.
