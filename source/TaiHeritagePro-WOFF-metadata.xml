            The original Tai Heritage was designed to reflect the traditional 
            hand-written style of the Tai Viet script that is treasured by the 
            Tai people of Vietnam. This gives it its angular style and flowing lines, 
            as opposed to the more rounded style used by Lao and some modern versions 
            of Tai Viet.
            
            The current Tai Heritage Pro provides coverage of the Tai Viet character
            reportoire encoded by Unicode 5.2. It uses both the SIL Graphite technology 
            and OpenType for correct placement of combining marks (vowels and tones). 
            
			Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

			     * Tai Heritage Pro Regular
			     * Tai Heritage Pro Bold

			For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.
